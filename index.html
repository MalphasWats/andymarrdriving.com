					<p>Thanks Andy for getting me through my test, I can't recommend you highly enough.  You were calm when it took me several attempts to get the hang of reverse parking and following your tips really helped me get through my test!! </p> Phil

					<p>Andy Marr, is a brilliant driving instructor. When I was learning with him he made me feel comfortable and confident behind the wheel, even though in the first few lessons I doubted my abilities. With Andy I passed first time with 1 minor.</p> Ollie
