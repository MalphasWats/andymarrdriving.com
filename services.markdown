# Learner Driving Training

At Andy Marr Driving we take pride in knowing that our Learner Driver Training is of the highest standard in Maidstone, the Medway Towns and surrounding villages. As fully qualified DSA approved driving instructors we know that we are fully capable of teaching anybody to drive, young or old.

We understand that a one method fits all strategy does not work when it comes to learning to drive. Its why at Andy Marr Driving we teach each student on an individual basis knowing that some students may need more encouragement or practice on certain principles or manoeuvres. The only thing that we keep the same for every student is our belief that the best way to learn to drive is by actually driving as much as possible.
