Andy Marr Driving School was formed in 2010 by Andy Marr, a qualified driving instructor since 2009.

Andy has always enjoyed driving rarely having less than two cars and enjoys continually tinkering with his own kit car. As a keen off roader and a member of numerous *pay and play* sites, Andy first started teaching friends to drive off road in 2000. This new found love of teaching to people to drive led Andy to start his Driving Instructor training in 2003, whilst remaining in full time employment. During this time Andy also spent two years teaching customers with the *Land Rover Experience* an off road driving course.

In 2009 Andy joined a large driving school full time. After a couple of years Andy realised that the company was becoming less about the students and more about the financial side so decided to set up the Andy Marr Driving School. The Andy Marr Driving School quickly became known in Maidstone, Medway and the surrounding area. Described as a friendly driving school that focuses on teaching students to drive as individuals, without adopting a one method fits all that is more common with larger driving schools.

The Andy Marr Driving School philosophy is to teach each student to drive to the best of their ability, not just to pass their driving test. The school often teaches things that are not required for the test but will aid the students driving for life. Ie: driving in the dark, and driving on dual carriage ways.

All of the schools cars are less than 3 years old, regularly maintained and checked and in top condition. For example Andyâ€™s current car is Vauxhall Corsa 1.3cdti(diesel) and has been praised a fantastic learner car by many students.
