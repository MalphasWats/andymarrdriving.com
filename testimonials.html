Thanks to Andy I passed my test the first time!  Andy is a fantastic teacher, is reliable and very patient.  When I started learning, I was quite nervous but he was able to calm my nerves through his clear communication and reassuring manner.  I would highly recommend Andy to anyone of any age/ability/experience who want to learn to drive well and succeed in their test!

Thanks Andy for getting me through my test, I can’t recommend you highly enough.  You were calm when it took me several attempts to get the hang of reverse parking and following your tips really helped me get through my test!!  Great and friendly service.  Thanks again.

Excellent driving instructor. He is very patient and explains things in detail. If you prefer to be shown what is required by a demonstration, he will show you. He has a wide knowledge of the Kent area giving you access to the best places to develop your driving skills. Once he believes you are ready for your practical assessment, he gives you the option to take a mock test when out on lesson and marks you accordingly, allowing you to get a feel of what is expected in the actual practical.
Highly recommended.

Andy Marr, is a brilliant driving instructor. When I was learning with him he made me feel comfortable and confident behind the wheel, even though in the first few lessons I doubted my abilities. With Andy I passed first time with 1 minor. He taught me everything I needed to pass and more. Driving lessons were fun and flexible.

Andy is a GREAT driving instructor. For someone that was extremely nervous about driving Andy helped me past the nervousness and helped me to become confident. He gives you the choice of what to do in your lessons. For example if you’re struggling with one particular manoeuvre he gives you the opportunity to practice it as much as you want.

Learning to drive is something I was extremely nervous about to begin with. However, Andy was extremely patient and calm with me when I got things wrong and began to worry, which helped me throughout. My learning experience became more enjoyable and something I looked forward to every week and I soon passed with thanks to the help and advice I received. I now say to people I think I am a good driver which can only be attributed to the instruction I was given

Andy Marr is not only a fantastic driving instructor but a wonderful person who’s main goals are too see first time drivers get themselves on the road as quick as possible. Andy had me on the road within 10minutes of my first lesson to get me used to it straight away and get my confidence going!! From this it was an enjoyable and educating time learning to drive and not just a chore. Andy has helped almost all the first time drivers in the local villages and hopefully he can continue to do this and extend his marvellous work into the near by towns to help hundreds more. I’d like to finish by thanking Andy for all he did with helping me through the whole process and keeping me confident and relaxed throughout it all.

I first came across Andy when I was looking for an intensive course after failing 6 driving tests with previous instructors.
After just a few lessons I felt immediately more confidant behind the wheel, Andy was quick to asses my needs and I never felt like my precious time was wasted with him. I had been having lessons for just over a year and I was progressing quicker than ever covering every avenue needed in order to get me up to the test standard. As well as being flexible to fit me in around work Andy would always be on hand for support outside of lesson hours. I would say that Andy is one of the most experienced professional driving instructors I have come across and persevered with me through my nerves to help me finally pass my test. I would highly recommend him no matter what stage you are at with learning to drive.
